    "1) **Markdown Cells** - These cells contain plain text (like the cell you are reading right now).\n",

    "\n",
    "For this assignment (and class) you don't need to worry about Markdown cells, just focus on the code cells for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2) How does a Jupyter Notebook work?\n",
    "Click on a code cell, it will outline itself in blue. Now you are in **Edit Mode** and can make change to the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "To run a cell, press `Shift + Enter` while the cell is highlighted in blue. \n",
    "\n",
    "All the text and numbers inside a code cell will be read by a computer, unless you add a `#` in front, making it a **comment**. Comments help explain what the code is doing to a programmer.\n",
