    "### Module\n",
    "A **module** is a single file containing Python code (typically ending in a `.py` extension) that contains functions and variables. \n",
    "- They can be imported into other Python files or notebooks\n",
    "- You use modules to organize code into smaller, reuseable parts\n",
    "- Ex: `even_sum.py` that we created during lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "*You will create your OWN module for this homework and use that we made during class.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Package\n",
    "A **package** is a group of modules, organized like a directory. \n",
    "- A package requires a special `__init__.py` file to tell Python that the ENTIRE directory is something you would like to import.\n",
    "- Packages can contain sub-pacakges\n",
    "- Ex: `BAGLE_Microlensing` is an example of a package (if you are in Dex's group, this should be familar to you). Or you could think of `paarti` if you are in Brianna's group.\n",
    "\n",
    "*You will NOT be working with a package for this homework.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Library\n",
    "A **library** is a much broader term that also refers to a collection of modules (like a package) but a library can also contain mulitple packages. \n",
    "- Libraries serve a much wider range of functionality for\n",
    "- Programmers use packages to have ready-to-go tools that can be used for data manipulation, web development, machine learning or simulations.\n",
    "- Ex: `numpy` is a very common library. Later in this course we will also be working some of the following libraries `matplotlib`, `scipy`, and `astropy`, `pandas`, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "*You WILL be working with the extensive numpy library for this homework!*\n",
